# EM tossing coins experiment
This is a simple implementation of Expectation-Maximization Algorithm given by *Do and Batzoglou* as **coin-tossing game**

For more information and the description of EM algorithm please read *What is the expectation maximization
algorithm? by Do and Batzoglou* [Link](http://ai.stanford.edu/~chuongdo/papers/em_tutorial.pdf)

You can play around with the initial parameters, just to make sure that you have a prior information that θ(A) should be greater or equal to θ(B).
